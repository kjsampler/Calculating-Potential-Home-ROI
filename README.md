# Project 3 
Introduction:
A time series analysis predicting return on investment for several Colorado zip codes. Zip codes were chosen based on locality and proximity to major cities. Some are rural zip codes, while others are centered around metropolitan areas. 
Data: 
Data was pulled from Zillow and included average home prices from April 1996 until April 2018. While the data was originally in wide format, it was transformed to long format to make it easier to perform manipulations and time series analysis. 
Modeling: 
For each zip code, the following steps were performed: 
1. Determine best values of p, d, and q. 
2. Split data into train and test sets. 
3. Make predictions on the data. 
4. Append the predictions to the test data set. 
5. Forecast 36 months into the future. 
6. Calculate ROI. 
This is followed by a brief section on conclusions.
